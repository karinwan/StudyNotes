# Initialize a Next.js app

### System requirements
See 
> https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation

To verify which version you have, if you're using npm, try:
```
$ npm version
```
You'll probably see something like `node: '22.9.0' `. 

### Automatic Installation
```
$ npx create-next-app@latest
```
