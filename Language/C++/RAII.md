# Resource Acquisition Is Initialization

- binds the life cycle of a resource that must be acquired before use (allocated heap memory, thread of execution, open socket, open file, locked mutex, disk space, database connectionâ€”anything that exists in limited supply) to the lifetime of an object.

- encapsulate each resource into a class, where
  - the constructor acquires the resource and establishes all class invariants or throws an exception if that cannot be done,
  - the destructor releases the resource and never throws exceptions;
  
- always use the resource via an instance of a RAII-class that either
  - has automatic storage duration or temporary lifetime itself, or
  - has lifetime that is bounded by the lifetime of an automatic or temporary object.
